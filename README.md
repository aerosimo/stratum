# Stratum
> *Reflects the layered rules behind card number generation. Validating a credit card refers to the process of running a computer algorithm
> that performs calculations using a credit card's number.
> When the algorithm shows that the card is valid, it means only that the card number
> is among those that could potentially exist with a given credit card company.
> For example, a random series of numbers would likely result in an invalid answer
> from the program, while an actual card number, even from a card that has expired
> or reached its credit limit, would show up as valid, since the number is one that
> the credit card company issued.*

## Project Structure

This `README.md` gives an overview of the project structure and instructions on how to build and deploy the application.

## Features

**SOAP & REST Web Service**: Exposes a `verify(String CardLongNumber)` method to retrieve daily horoscope and store it in the database.

## Getting Started

![Project Codes & Tasks](/img/code.jpg "Project Codes and Task")

---

### Prerequisites

>- **Apache TomEE 10**: is the application server used during development, but any Jakarta EE 10-compliant server should work.
>- **Java 25**: Ensure you have Java 25 installed as TomEE 10 targets Jakarta EE 10.
>- **Maven**: The project uses Maven for dependency management with any IDE of choice.

### Dependencies

The required dependencies are defined in `pom.xml`. Below are the key dependencies:

- **Jakarta EE 10 API**: Provides JAX-WS support.
- **JAX-WS**: For SOAP web service implementation.
- **JAX-RS**: For REST web service implementation.

### Building and Running the Application

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aerosimo/stratum.git
    cd stratum
    ```

2. **Build the project using Maven**:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Deploy the WAR file**:

   After building the project, deploy the generated `WAR` file from the `target/` directory into the `webapps/` folder of your preferred Jakarta EE 10-compatible server.

4. **Start your preferred Jakarta EE 10-compatible server**:

   Start server and access the application:

    - SOAP Service: WSDL at `http://localhost:8081/stratum/ws/stratum?wsdl`
    - REST Service: http://localhost:8081/stratum/api/stratum/validateCard/cardnumber
    - Web Interface: `http://localhost:8081/stratum/index.jsp`

## Detailed Explanation of Components

### 1. **SOAP Web Service** (JAX-WS)

The SOAP web service is implemented in `com.aerosimo.ominet.stratum.api.soap.StratumSOAP.java`.

Example sendMail SOAP Request:
```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" xmlns:ast="https://aerosimo.com/api/ws/astrology">
    <soap:Header/>
    <soap:Body>
        <ast:sendEmail />
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```
### 2. **REST Web Service** (JAX-RS)

The REST web service is implemented in `com.aerosimo.ominet.astrology.api.rest.AstrologyREST.java`.

Example horoscope REST Request:
```curl
POST http://localhost:8081/astrology/api/astrology/horoscope

```
Example sendMail REST Response:
```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Daily horoscope update initiated."
    }
```

```
